            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Plague is more immediately from God, than any other Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or Diſeaſe is; for it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtroke of God. The Scribe is more properly ſaid to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46052:3"/> write, than the pen; and he that maketh and keepeth the Clock, is more properly ſaid to make it go and ſtrike, than the wheels and poizes that hang upon it: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Workman to effect his work, rather than the tools which he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as inſtruments. So the Lord of Hoſts, who is the chief Agent and Mover in all things, and in all actions, may more fitly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to effect and bring to paſs all Judgements, yea, all things which are done in the Earth, than any inferiour or ſubordinate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſeeing they are but his tools and inſtruments, which he rules and guides according to his own Will, Power, and Providence. I know ſome Phyſitians aſcribe it to the heat of the Air, and ſometimes to the drineſs of the Air, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the corruption of the Air, &amp; ſometimes to the corruption of mens blood, &amp; ſometimes to Satan, and ſometimes to the malignancy of the Planets; but certainly thoſe are Phyſitians of no value, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46052:4"/> cannot look above ſecond cauſes, to the Firſt Cauſe, that cannot look to <hi>the wheel within the wheel.</hi> The <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> Plague is a hidden thing, a ſecret thing; it is a ſickneſs, a diſeaſe, that more immediately comes from God, than any other ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſeaſe doth. <hi>Behold the hand</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Lord is upon thy cattel which is in the field, upon the horſes, upon the aſſes, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the ſheep, there ſhall be a very grievous murrain.</hi> The word here tranſlated <hi>murrain,</hi> is in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3. termed <hi>peſtilence;</hi> and it is one and the ſame diſeaſe, though when it is applied to cattel, it be uſually rendred by murrain, yet when 'tis applied to men, as in the Scripture laſt cited, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the peſtilence. <hi>Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattel,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the extraordinary imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power and work of God, without the intervening of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe or humane operation. This open plague, this plague without doors, that principally
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46052:4"/> fell upon the cattel, was from the immediate hand of God. 'Tis God alone that ſingles out the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the City, the Town, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, the Family, the Perſon, that he will ſtrike with the plague; for all ſecond cauſes are ordered by the firſt cauſe, as every inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ruled or over-ruled by the will and hand of him that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. When a man goes with his Axe to cut down Trees in the Wood, there is an equal aptneſs in the Axe to cut down one Tree as well as another, an Oake as well as an Aſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is ſtill ruled by the will of him that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles it. So 'tis here, the noiſome peſtilence, or the peſtilence of griefs (as the Hebrew runs in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 3.) hath an equal aptneſs to cut down one man as well as another, the rich as well as the poor, the honourable as well as the baſe, the ſtrong as well as the weak, the Prince as well as the peaſant, the Emperour as well as the Carter; but it is ſtill over-rul'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46052:5"/> by the Lord himſelf, who gives it a Commiſſion to cut off ſuch and ſuch in this Kingdom, and that in this City, and that in this Town, and that in this Family; and that to ſpare, ſave, and paſſe by all the reſt. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. you ſhall read of four horſes when the four ſeals were opened, 1. A white horſe. 2. A red horſe. 3. A black horſe. 4. A pale horſe. After Chriſt had ridden upon the white horſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel, then follows the red horſe, a Type of War; then the black horſe, an hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick of Famine; and then the pale horſe, the emblem of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Now all theſe horſes, theſe plagues, were of Chriſts ſending. From thoſe words <hi>Judges</hi> 3. 20. <hi>I have a meſſage from God unto thee, O King,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ehud.</hi> Lo, his ponyard was Gods meſſage; from whence one well obſerveth, That not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 8, 9, 10.</note> the vocal admonitions, but the real judgements of God, are his errands and inſtructions to the world. 'Twas a mad principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46052:5"/> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who referred all the judgments, calamities, and miſeries that came upon them to the Devil for their Author; as if there could be any evil in the <note place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> City, and the Lord have no hand in it. Now in that 'tis the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that ſends the peſtilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a people, how ſhould this comfort us, and quiet us! how ſhould this cool us, and calm us! how ſhould this ſatisfie us, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence us before the Lord, and cauſe us to lay our hands upon our mouths, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. and as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. and as <hi>Ely</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. and as the Church did, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>And this I ſhall make evident by an induction of Ten particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are the only people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in all the World that are under divine Promiſes of protection and preſervation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>Job</hi> 5. 20, 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 13, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 20, 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. throughout. Turn to theſe ſweet promiſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46052:11"/> that there are no men on earth that can or may lay their hands on theſe precious promiſes, and ſay, theſe promiſes are mine, but only the godly man. Theſe Promiſes are Gods Bonds, which the godly man may put in ſuit, and urge God with, and plead hard in prayer, which no other men <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sirtorious,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, paid what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with fair words as Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers uſe to do: but ſo doth not God. Men often eat their words; but God will never eat his; <hi>hath he ſpoken, and ſhall it not come to paſs?</hi> Joſh. 23. 14. Ezek 12. 25. Ch. 24. 14.</note> may. The Promiſes of God are a Chriſtians <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> his chief Evidences that he hath to ſhew for his preſervation, for his protection, for his ſalvation. Divine Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are Gods deed of gift, they are the only Aſſurance which the Saints have to ſhew for their right and Title to Chriſt, to Heaven, and to all the glory and happineſs of another world. O how highly do men prize their Charters and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges! and how carefully do they keep and lay up the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Aſſurances of their Lands! Oh how ſhould Saints then treaſure up thoſe precious Promiſes, which are to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all Conveyances and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46052:12"/> for their preſervation, protection, maintenance, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, comfort, and everlaſting happineſs. The Promiſes are a Mine of rich treaſuries, they are a Garden full of the choyceſt and ſweeteſt flowers of Paradiſe; in them are wrapt up all celeſtial contentments and enjoyments: and therefore ſtudy them more than ever, and prize them more than ever, and improve them more than ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you conſider their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> near and dear Relations to God: They are his ſervants, his friends, his children, his members, his Spouſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By all which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they ſtand upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ground, for preſervation and protection, above all others in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you conſider that high value, and eſteem, and price, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the Lord puts upon them: He eſteems them as the apple of his eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8. He accounts them as his Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46052:12"/> He prizes them as his portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. yea, as his pleaſant portion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 10. He accounts them his Crown, yea, his Crown of Glory, and his Royal Diadem, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 3. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſpeaking of his Church) <hi>ſhalt alſo be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the hand of thy God.</hi> Yea, he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes one Saint above all the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. By all which 'tis moſt evident that they ſtand upon the advantage ground, as to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and protection, above all other people in the world; for God accounts all the world beſides to be but as dirt, as duſt, as chaff, as thorns and bryars, that are only fit to be caſt into the fire to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and deſtroy'd. When Pearls grew common at <hi>Rome</hi> they began to be ſlighted: But Saints are ſuch Pearls of price, that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſlight.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you conſider that they are the only people in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> world that are in Covenant with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46052:13"/> 
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 38, 39, 40. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Some do derive the word <hi>Berith</hi> (which ſignifies the <hi>Covenant)</hi> from a Root which ſignifies to <hi>purifie,</hi> to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> and to <hi>ſelect:</hi> And verily, when the Lord makes a Covenant with any, he doth ſeparate them from others, he honours them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, and he looks on them and owns them for his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, and delights in them as the choſen and choyceſt of all others. <hi>The whole world lyes in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> John 1. 5. 19. By this alſo 'tis evident, that the people of God ſtand upon the advantage ground for their preſervation and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction above all others in the world.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If you conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon carriage and deportment of God towards his people in former times of calamities and great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Did he not provide an Ark for righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſafer in his Ark of three Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46052:13"/> high, than <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his crew were in their Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the height of five thouſand <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heyl. Coſm.</hi> l. 3.</note> one hundred fourty ſix paces, as is reported. And did he not provide a <hi>Zoar</hi> for righteous <hi>Lot. Heſiod</hi> ſpeaks of thirty thouſand Demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods that were keepers of men. But what are ſo many thouſand gods to that one God that neither <note place="margin">Pſal. 121. 3, 4, 5. Iſa. 27. 3.</note> ſlumbers nor ſleeps, but day and night keeps his people as his Jewels, as the apple of his eye, that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in his pavilion, as a <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 20.</note> Prince keeps his Favourite. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have their retiring rooms and withdrawing Chambers, which are ſacred places; and ſo hath God his, and there he ſhelters the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Heaven. Gods gracious Providence is his golden Cabinet, where his children are as ſafe as if they were in Heaven. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 20, 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 3. <hi>They have conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy hidden ones,</hi> hidden under the hollow of thy hand, and under the ſhadow of thy wing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46052:14"/> ſafe from dangers in the midſt of dangers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39. 16, 17, 18. How wonderfully did he preſerve the three children (or rather the three Non-conformable Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) from burning in the midſt of the flames, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and <hi>Daniel</hi> from being devoured in the Lyons Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And ſo Gods mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones were his marked ones, and his ſaved and preſerved ones, when the deſtroying Angel ſlew old and young, <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 9. 4, 6. And reverend <hi>Beza</hi> and his Family was four ſeveral times viſited with the Plague, and yet as often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as they were viſited; and this good man was very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and comforted under that and other ſore afflictions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him, by that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. which made him the more highly to prize it, and the more dearly to hugg it all his dayes, as himſelf witneſſeth in his Writings on this Pſalm. There is a Dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Heathen and a Jew after the Jewes return from captivity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46052:14"/> (all Nations round about them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies to them) The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then asked the Jew, <hi>How he and his Countreymen could hope for any ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every one of you is a ſilly ſheep, compaſſed about with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wolves? I but,</hi> ſaith the Jew, <hi>we are kept by ſuch a Shepheard, as can kill all thoſe wolves when he pleaſeth.</hi> Now by all this alſo 'tis evident, that the people of God ſtand upon the advantage ground, as to their preſervation and protection above all other people in the world.</p>

When the ſervants of God are hated by men, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, and forſaken of men, yet they are then viſited and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Angels. Princes have their guards, but what poor, what weak, what contemptible guards are theirs, to thoſe legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that daily guard the Saints! When men can clip the wings of Angels, and impriſon or pinion theſe heavenly ſouldiers, then and not till then, ſhall they be able to have their wills upon the poor people of God. Oh the honour, the dignity, the ſafety and ſecurity of the Saints, in a life guard ſo full of ſtate and ſtrength! Well may we ſay, Come taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is, in affording
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46052:15"/> his children ſo glorious an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Now by this argument as well as the reſt, 'tis evident, that the people of God ſtand upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ground as to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preſervation and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, above all other people in the world.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If you conſider that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> they are the onely people that do <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 6, 7, 8, 9. Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> bear up the name and glory of God in the world; they are the onely people that worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth, and from ſuch worſhippers 'tis that God hath the incomes of his glory. The holy hearts, the holy lives, the holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the holy wayes, the holy walkings, and the holy worſhip that is performed by the Saints, are the ſprings from whence all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour riſes to the Lord in this world. The people of God are <note place="margin">Deut. 26. 17. 18. Pſal. 116. 16.

And do you think that God will not have a ſpecial care of ſuch, that are the onely promoters of his honour and glory in this world? Doubtleſs he will. Now by this argument 'tis further evident, that the people of God do ſtand upon the advantage ground, as to their outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and protection, above all other people in the world.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, If you do but ſeriouſly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> conſider what a mighty intereſt the people of God have in the Grand Favourite of Heaven, <hi>viz. The Lord</hi>

Now look what intereſt the wife hath in the husband, the child in the father, the members in the head, the ſubject in his Prince, the ſervant in his Lord, the branches in the root, the building in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that the believer hath in Chriſt, and much more. Chriſt is not like the Bramble, that receives good but yields none; but he is like the Fig-tree, the Vine, the Olive. All that are intereſted in him, that pertain to him, are the better for him; <hi>they all receive of his fulneſs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 1. 16. Col. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>grace for grace.</hi> Now, doubtleſs, all that intereſt that Jeſus Chriſt hath in God the Father, he will improve to the utmoſt for their good, that have an intereſt in him. Now by this argument 'tis alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the people of God do ſtand upon the advantage ground above all others in the world, as to their outward preſervation and protection.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:46052:17"/>
               <p>Ninthly, If you conſider Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> tender and fatherly care of his people, and his ſingular indulgence towards them, of which you may read much in the bleſſed Scripture. Among the many choice Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which might be produced, take theſe as a taſte, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13, 14. <hi>Like as a father pitieth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him; for he knoweth our frame, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth that we are duſt.</hi> There is an ocean of love and pity in the fathers heart towards his children; but 'tis but a drop to that which is in God. He hit the mark, that ſaid, <hi>Tam pius nemo, tam pater nemo,</hi> No fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> is like our father.

               <p>The care that God exerciſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, is,</p>

               <p n="4">4. 'Tis an Effectual Care, a Proſperous Care, a Succeſsful Care, a Flouriſhing Care. Men many times riſe early and go to bed late, and take a great deal of care at home and abroad, and all to no purpoſe; but the care of God is

When <hi>Juba</hi> King of the Moors march'd through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of <hi>Africa,</hi> a young man of his Company wounded a Lion; but the year following, when <hi>Juba</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Lion again meets the Army, and from among them all ſingles out the man that hurt him, and tears him in pieces, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the reſt to paſs by in peace and ſafety. And thus the Lord Jeſus, who is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> is alwayes ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <note place="margin">Rev. 5. 5.</note> the cauſe of his people, and to take vengeance on all that have wounded his people, or made a prey of his people; as you may clearly and fully ſee in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> chap. 25. and 35. Now by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as well as by all the reſt, 'tis evident, that the people of God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46052:23"/> ſtand upon the advantage ground, as to their outward preſervation and protection, above all other people in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if this be ſo, How comes it to paſs that in this time of great mortality, many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious people of the Lord have been taken away, as well as others; the raging peſtilence having carried many pious ſouls out of this world, of whom the world was <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 38.</note> not worthy? The Saint as well as the ſinner, hath fallen by the hand of the deſtroying Angel; in this day we have ſeen that word made good, <hi>viz. That all things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean and to the unclean, to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Queſtion I ſhall give theſe eight ſhort Anſwers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God hath ſmitten ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> good men of all perſwaſions, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46052:24"/> none might be proud, ſecure, or cenſorious, and that all might take the alarme, and prepare to meet <note place="margin">Amos 4. 10, 11, 12.</note> their God, and that all may keep humble and tremble, becauſe of his righteous judgements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The number of thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that feared the Lord that have been taken away by the peſtilence, are but few, very few, if compared with the many thouſands of others that never knew what 'twas to ſet up God as the main object of their fear, and that never knew experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally what a changed nature, a ſanctified frame of heart, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, or a title to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meant. Oh that we had not cauſe to fear that hell hath had a very large harveſt within theſe few laſt moneths.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes Gods own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> people ſin with others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſmart with others, when God takes the Rod into his own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46052:24"/> hand. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Numb. 20.</note> with others, and therefore their Carkaſes fell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as others. This may ſometimes be the reaſon why ſome good men fall in a common calamity, but I dare not ſay that 'tis alwayes the reaſon why ſome good men fall in a common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I believe there are ſeveral choice Chriſtians that have been ſwept away in this day of the Lords wrath, who have not ſinned with the wicked, though they have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with the wicked. Many have fallen by this diſpenſation, who yet have kept their garments pure <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 4.</note> and clean, and are now walking with Chriſt in white. I do not think that thoſe Saints that have died by the plague, were greater ſinners than thoſe that have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the plague; yea, I have ſeveral reaſons to perſwade me, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe precious ſervants of the Lord that have died of the plague, had more grace in their hearts, and leſs ſin in their lives,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46052:25"/> than many other Saints that have been pitied and ſpared in this day of the Lords anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, No godly man dies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in any common calamity, till his <note place="margin">Job 5. 26. Rev. 11. 6, 7. Acts 13. 25, 36.</note> glaſs be run, and his work done, and he prepared and fitted for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world: <hi>Job</hi> 14. 5. <hi>Seeing his dayes are determined, the number of his moneths are with thee; thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> God hath ſet every man both his time and his task. In this Scripture as in a glaſſe you may ſee the true reaſon why ſome likely to live long, die ſoon, even whileſt their bones are full of marrow, and their breaſts are full of milk, and others that are more weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, live long, yea very long; the reaſon is, becauſe God hath ſet bounds to every mans life to a very day, I, to a very hour. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time</hi> (or <hi>warfare) will I wait till my change come,</hi> i. e. <hi>till my death, Job</hi> calls death a change. Death is not an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation or extinction, but a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:46052:25"/>
               <p n="1"> 1. 'Tis the laſt change that we ſhall meet with till the reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a laſting, yea, an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting change; it puts every man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eternal condition of happineſs or miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis an univerſal change; and that, 1. In reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all muſt meet with it, <hi>'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all men once to die.</hi> 2. In <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> reſpect of the whole man body and ſoul. Death lodges the body in the grave, and puts the ſoul into heaven or hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis a different change, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon changed. 'Tis terrible to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It will put a full period to all his outward mercies, comforts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> contentments and enjoyments. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> a Turkiſh Emperour, the firſt of that Nation that conquered <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> lying at the point of death, after many glorious victories com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a white ſheet ſhould be born before him to his grave, upon the point of a ſpear, with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46052:26"/> this proclamation, <hi>Theſe are the rich ſpoils which Saladine carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him: of all his triumphs and victories, of all the riches and realms that he had, now nothing at all is left him but this ſheet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It will put a full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to all his hopes. Now he ſhall never hope for mercy more, nor never hope for pardon more, nor never hope for heaven more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It will put a full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to all the means of grace. Now he ſhall never hear Sermon more, nor never read the Word more, nor never enjoy the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the people of God more, nor never taſte any of the dainties of Gods Houſe more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It will put a full period <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to the patience, forbearance, and long-ſuffering of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It will put a full peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to all the pleaſures of ſin. Now the ſinner ſhall never have one merry day more. In Hell there is no ſinging but howling, no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick but madneſs, no ſporting but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46052:26"/> ſighing, no dancing but wringing or hands and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, It will put a full peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to all gracious reprieves. The ſinner in his life time hath had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a reprieve from many executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wrath and judgement; Oh but now he ſhall never have one reprieve more.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It will put a full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> period to all the ſtrivings of the Holy Spirit. Now the Spirit ſhall <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3. Rev. 3. 20.</note> never ſtrive with the ſinner more, now Chriſt will never knock at the ſinners door, at the ſinners heart more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, It will put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> a full period to all gracious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Now the ſinner ſhall never caſt his eye upon one gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more. The ſinner in his life time hath had many gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples before his eyes, which it may be at times have had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, convincing, ſilenceing, and reſtraining power in them; Oh but now he ſhall never have his eye
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46052:27"/> upon one pious example more. All hell will not afford one good example. In a word, now the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall find by woful experience, that death will be an inlet to three dreadful things: 1. To judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. 2. To an irreverſible ſentence of condemnation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. 3. To endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs ſufferings. Not many years ſince in the Town of <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> there was a young man, who being very weak, and nigh to the grave, and under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the wrath of God, and ſuppoſing that he was preſently going down to the Pit, to Hell, he cried out, <hi>O that God would ſpare me but two dayes, O that God would ſpare me but two dayes, O that God would ſpare me, but two dayes.</hi> This poor creature trembled at the very thoughts of wrath to come. <hi>O who can dwell with everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? who can dwell with a devouring fire?</hi> Iſa. 33. 14.</p>

                  <hi>I deſire to baſten.</hi> Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death, being raiſed up in his bed, and ſeeing the Sun ſhine, was deſired to ſpeak his mind, upon which he ſaid, <hi>There is but one Sun that giveth light to the whole world, but one righteouſneſs, one communion of ſaints; as concerning death, I ſee ſuch joy of ſpirit, that if I ſhould have pardon of life on the one ſide, and ſentence of death on the other, I had rather chuſe a thouſand times to die than to live.</hi> So Mr. <hi>John Holland</hi> lying at the point of death, ſaid, <hi>What brightneſs do I ſee?</hi> and being told it was the ſun-ſhine, <hi>No,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>My Saviour ſhines: now farewel world, welcome heaven, the day-ſtar from on high hath viſited me. Preach at my funeral, God dealeth comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and familiarly with man; I feel his mercy, I ſee his majeſty, whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God he knoweth, but I ſee things that are unutterable.</hi> Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> found ſo much comfort from the Scriptures upon his death-bed, that he would have riſen, and have gone into the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46052:28"/> Pulpit, to tell others what he had felt in his ſoul. And by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that I have had from ſome good hands, ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians that have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died of the plague, have gone to heaven under as high a ſpirit of joy, of comfort, of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of a holy triumph, as any of the laſt mentioned wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, or as any other that ever I heard of or read of; the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which hath been, and ſtill is a ſingular Cordial to all their relations and friends that yet ſurvive them.</p>
               <p>But as I was ſaying, No godly man falls in any Common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity till his glaſſe be run, and his work done; ſo I ſay of all thoſe dear ſervants of the Lord that have fallen by the peſtilence in the midſt of us, their hour was come, and <note place="margin">John 7. 30. chap. 8. 19, 20. 2 Tim. 4. 6, 7.</note> their courſe was finiſhed. Had God had any further doing work, or ſuffering work, or bearing work, or witneſſing work for them in this world, 'twas not all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46052:29"/> the Angels in heaven, nor all the malignant diſeaſes in the world, that could ever have cut them off from the land of the living. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, his two ſiſters <note place="margin">John 11. 21, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> came to Chriſt with tears in their eyes, and ſad complaints in their mouths. <hi>Lord if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died,</hi> ſaid <hi>Martha;</hi> and <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mary:</hi> And is not this the common language of many this day, when ſuch and ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians have fallen by the peſtilence; <hi>Oh if ſuch a Phyſitian had been here, they had not died; or if they had been let blood, they had not died; or if they had taken ſuch a potion, they had not died; or if they had eat but of ſuch or ſuch meats, they had not died; or if they had not lived in ſuch a foggy air, they had not died; or if they had not been ſhut up in ſuch cloſe narrow naſty rooms and places, they had not died; or had they been but ſo wiſe and happy as to have applyed ſuch or ſuch a remedy, they might have been alive to this day.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:46052:29"/> Not conſidering with <hi>Job, that the dayes of man are determined, and his bounds appointed, which he cannot paſs.</hi> The time and place, and every circumſtance of his diſſolution, is decreed from all eternity. That one man dies in the field, another in his bed, one at ſea, another on the ſhore; one of an Apoplexy in the head, another of a <hi>Struma</hi> in the neck; one of a Squinacy in the throat, another of a Cough and Conſumption of the Lungs; that ſo many thouſands dies of Obſtructions, Inflamations, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Gouts, Peſtilence, it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained in heaven. The hand of the Lord is in all, and he it is that having brought us into the world at his pleaſure, will take us hence at his appointment. The Jewes have a ſaying, <hi>That God hath four Keyes under his own Girdle:</hi> 1. <hi>The Key of the Clouds.</hi> 2. <hi>The Key of the Womb.</hi> 3. <hi>The Key of the Heart.</hi> And 4. <hi>The Key of Death, the Key of the Grave.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, God ſometimes takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> away his deareſt children in the Common Calamity, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wicked men. Becauſe the hand of the Lord hath touch'd ſome of his deareſt ſervants in this ſore Viſitation, how do the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſult rejoyce, and triumph; they ſay, Ahah, ſo would we have it. As the Fire-flie leaps and dances in the fire, ſo do wicked men rejoyce in the ſufferings and death of the people of God. How do many wicked men bleſs themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have eſcaped the hand of the deſtroying Angel, when ſuch and ſuch have fallen by it! Oh how proud, how obdurate, <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note> how impudent, are many grown, becauſe they have eſcaped the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent judgement, when many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have been a thouſand times better than themſelves, have been ſent to their graves.

               <p>Seventhly, Notwithſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> outward promiſes that the Lord hath made concerning the protection and preſervation of his children, yet he ſtill reſerves a liberty to himſelf, to chaſtiſe his <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

Thus all the proceedings of God in his righteous judgements, which in themſelves are juſt, righteous, and ſtrait, without the leaſt obliquity, ſeem to us ſtrange and crooked. That the wicked ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and the righteous be afflicted; that good men ſhould be in bonds, when bad men walk at large; that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould make the bricks, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> dwell in the houſes; that ſome of the beſt of Chriſtians ſhould fall by the peſtilence, when many of the worſt of ſinners have their lives for a prey; theſe are ſome of thoſe myſterious providences that many times make ſome of the beſt of Chriſtians to ſtagger in their judgements; and why ſo, but becauſe they look upon Gods proceedings through a double <hi>medium</hi> of fleſh and ſpirit; and hence it comes to paſs that allthings ſeem to run croſs, and that Gods moſt juſt and righteous proceedings, are not ſo clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned, as otherwiſe they might

The wheels in a Watch or in a Clock, move contrary one to another, ſome one way, ſome another, yet all ſhew the skill and intent of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſhew the time, or to make the Clock to ſtrike: ſo in this world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providences ſeem to run croſs to divine promiſes; the wicked are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the righteous are taken away; yet in the concluſion all iſſues in the will, purpoſe, and glory of God.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, and laſtly, God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſeveral of his own dear children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> away by the peſtilence, to wipe off that reproach which Atheiſts and wicked men are apt to caſt upon the Lord, as if he were partial, and his wayes not equal.

Sometimes Gods manner is to begin

Sometimes when God intends to bring a common and general deſtruction upon the enemies, oppreſſors, haters and perſecuters of his people, he is wont firſt to ſcourge his own till the blood comes. <hi>I took the cup at the Lords hands</hi> (he means the cup of Gods fury, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 17.) <hi>and made all the Nations to drink</hi> (that is propheſied, that they ſhould certainly drink of it) <hi>unto whom the Lord had ſent me.</hi> But who were to drink firſt of this cup? <hi>Mark</hi> he tells us <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Jeruſalem and the Cities of Judah, and the Kings thereof, and the Princes thereof;</hi> Theſe were to begin in this cup to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> to <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as he ſhews in the verſes following: Now all theſe were bitter and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Ah ſinners, ſinners, do not inſult over the poor people of God, becauſe here and there the hand of the Lord hath

                  <note place="margin">See verſe 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy God, that pleadeth the cauſe of his people; behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou ſhalt no more drink it again: but I will put it into the hands of them that afflict thee, which have ſaid to thy ſoul, bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over.</hi> And that word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 12. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, behold, they</hi> (meaning his own peculiar people) <hi>whoſe judgement was not to drink of the cup</hi> (that is, the cup of my wrath) <hi>have aſſuredly drunken; and art thou he that ſhalt altogether go unpuniſhed? thou ſhalt not go unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but thou ſhalt ſurely drink of it;</hi> or <hi>drinking drink,</hi> as the Hebrew runs. I have not ſpared my own dear people (ſaith God) who might have expected this favour at my hands, before any people under heaven, upon the account
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46052:34"/> of my relation to them, my affections for them, and my Covenant with them all; and do you think that I will ſpare you? No, drinking you ſhall drink, that is, you ſhall certainly drink of this cup of my wrath, and you ſhall ſignally and viſibly drink of this cup of my wrath. And that word <hi>Iſa</hi> 49. 25, 26. <hi>But thus ſaith the Lord, even the Captains of the mighty ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will ſave thy children; and I will feed them that oppreſs thee, with their own fleſh; and they ſhall be drunken with their own blood, as with ſweet wine; and all fleſh ſhall know that I the Lord is thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.</hi> Oh that thoſe men would lay theſe Scriptures to heart, who rejoyce and glory in the ſufferings of the poor people of God; and becauſe ſome of them have fallen by the hand of the deſtroying Angel, conſidering that the deſign of God herein, is to ſtop the mouth of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that none may ſay, that he is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46052:35"/> either partial or fond. Such men that have been eye-witneſſes of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial dealing with his own people in this day of his wrath, ſhould rather be down in the mouth than up in their ſpirits; they ſhould rather be ſilent than raving againſt the people of the Lord; they ſhould rather tremble than rejoyce, for if God deal thus with his green-trees, how will he deal <note place="margin">Luke 23. 31.

The Phyſitian turns the hour-glaſſe, and reſolves the phyſick ſhall work ſo long, the impatient Patient cries out, Oh I am in pain, Oh how I am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, Oh what would I not give for a little eaſe, Oh me thinks every hour is a year; but the wiſe Phyſitian knowing the fitteſt time, will not ſuffer him to have any reſt or comfort, till the phyſick hath had its proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. Thus many times Gods dear children when they are under ſore tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, they cry out, How long Lord, how long ſhall this Rod lie upon our backs, how long ſhall thy anger ſmoak, how long ſhall the judgement conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; but God will turn a deaf ear, and make them wait his time, which is alwayes the beſt time. And therefore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46052:41"/> though God knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, yet he will take his own time to deliver them out of temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <q>That though the godly are not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the plague, yet they are ſtill delivered by the plague; by it they ſhall be delivered from all their ſins.</q>

               <p>Death is not <hi>Mors hominis,</hi> but <hi>Mors peccati;</hi> not the death of the man, but the death of his ſin. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> died, the Philiſtims died to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him; ſo when a believer dies (be it by the peſtilence or any other diſeaſe) his ſin dies with him. As death came in by ſin, ſo ſin goes out by death. As the worm kills the worm that bred it, ſo death kills ſin that bred it. The <hi>Perſians</hi> had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day in the year, wherein they uſed to kill all ſerpents and venemous
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46052:41"/> creatures; ſuch a day as that will the day of death be to every believer. When the peſtilence hath put a period to a Chriſtians dayes, then he ſhall never be proud more, nor paſſionate more, nor unbelieving more, nor worldly more, nor neglective of duty more, nor grieve the ſpirit of God more, nor wound Conſcience more, nor break his peace with God more, nor ſad the hearts of the righteous more, nor open the mouth of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my more; the death of the body ſhall quite deſtroy the body of death: ſo that as ſin was the Midwife that brought death into the world, ſo death ſhall be the grave that ſhall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin in. When the peſtilence takes away a godly man, it doth not take him away in his ſins, but it takes him way from his ſins. And as death, as the peſtilence (where it kills) rids the believer of all his ſins, ſo 'twill rid him of all his troubles. Death cures all diſeaſes, the aking head, and the unbelieving heart; <hi>

In this world we are all <hi>Benonies,</hi> the ſons of ſorrow. The way to heaven is by weeping croſſe. Chriſts-paſſion week was before his Aſcention day. None paſſes to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, but by burning <hi>Seraphims.</hi> We cannot go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but through the Red Sea. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> through the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Tears, and croſſed the ſwift river of <hi>Jordan,</hi> before they came to the ſweet waters of <hi>Siloam.</hi> If a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man die of the peſtilence, he ſhall never be haunted, tempted, and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted by Satan more, he ſhall never ſee a cloud, a frown, a wrinkle in the face of God more; the Chair of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence ſhall be to him but a Chair of State, by which he ſhall be brought into the preſence of the King of Kings. If the plague prove mortal to a godly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46052:42"/> man or woman, it ſhall do that for them, which all ordinances could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, and which all their duties could never do, and which all their graces could never do, and which all their experiences could never do for them, and which all the aſſiſtances, influences and incomes of the holy ſpirit could never do for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhall at once free them from all their ſins, ſnares, ſorrows, tears, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, afflictions, oppreſſions, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, vexations, and perſecutions. Death will cure the believer of all his bodily diſeaſes and diſtempers at once. And thus I have done with theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maximes and Concluſions; the Lord make them as ſo many heavenly Cordials to the Chriſtian Reader.</p>
